# TRAVEL-Web-Application
I actively contributed to the TRAVEL project, in which we developed a customized and professional travel planning platform. My
main role in this project was project coordination and management, in which I collaborated with the team, determined project
milestones, and developed innovative solutions. We created a user-friendly interface for users, using advanced HTML and CSS to
create customized travel itineraries. My contribution in this project was to improve customer satisfaction and engagement rates and
improve our platform. Provided a letter of appreciation.
